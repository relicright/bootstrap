                Images have classes that can modify their styles as well:
                img-responsive - makes the image scale depending on its parent div's size
                center-block - center the image in its parent div
                img-circle - make the image circular
                img-rounded - round the edges of the image
                img-thumbnail - creates a border around the image like a thumbnail
